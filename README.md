Built using [Svelte]() + [Sapper](), deployed onto [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

### Local Development

You'll need [NodeJS](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) and a package manager such as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to build or run this project locally. Here's the instructions:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:himynameisdave/isbobbarkerstillalive.git

# cd into it
cd isbobbarkerstillalive/

# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Alternative: npm install

# Run in dev mode
yarn run dev

```

The app will now be running over at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

You can also produce a production-ready version by running:

```bash
yarn run export
```

There's a ton of other stuff you can do with Sapper, so consult the [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) guide if you're unsure about something.
